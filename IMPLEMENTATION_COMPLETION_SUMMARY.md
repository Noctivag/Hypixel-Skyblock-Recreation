## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Thread Isolation Strategy
```
Game Tick Thread Pool (8-16 threads)
â”œâ”€â”€ Game logic processing
â”œâ”€â”€ Entity updates
â””â”€â”€ World simulation

I/O Thread Pool (8-16 threads)
â”œâ”€â”€ Database operations
â”œâ”€â”€ Redis operations
â””â”€â”€ File system access

World Generation Thread Pool (4-8 threads)
â”œâ”€â”€ Chunk generation
â”œâ”€â”€ Structure placement
â””â”€â”€ Biome calculations

Scheduled Thread Pool (4-8 threads)
â”œâ”€â”€ Periodic tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ Cleanup operations
â””â”€â”€ Monitoring tasks
```

### Database Schema (Embedded Document Pattern)
```json
{
  "_id": "player-uuid",
  "username": "PlayerName",
  "accessoriesBag": {
    "unlockedSlots": 0,
    "accessories": [],
    "talismanPowers": {}
  },
  "skillXP": {
    "combat": 0,
    "mining": 0,
    "farming": 0,
    // ... all skills embedded
  },
  "collectionProgress": {
    "collections": {},
    "milestones": {},
    "unlockedRecipes": []
  },
  "rngMeterState": {
    "bossProgress": {},
    "lastReset": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "totalRngDrops": 0
  }
}
```

### Redis Data Structures
```
Bazaar Orderbook (Sorted Sets):
- Key: bazaar:orderbook:{itemId}:buy
- Score: price (ascending for sell, descending for buy)
- Value: orderId

Player Stats (Hashes):
- Key: player:stats:{playerUUID}
- Fields: combat_level, current_zone, etc.

Server Status (Sets):
- Key: server:status:{serverId}
- Value: JSON status object
```

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Async-Pflicht Implementation
- **Zero blocking operations** in game tick thread
- **CompletableFuture-based** async operations
- **Thread pool isolation** prevents cascade failures

### 2. Caching Strategy
- **Local cache**: 5-minute TTL for frequently accessed data
- **Redis cache**: 1-minute TTL for real-time data
- **MongoDB**: Persistent storage with optimized indexes

### 3. Load Balancing
- **Progression-based routing**: Players matched to appropriate instances
- **Skill-level instances**: Combat level 6-10 â†’ Beginner combat zone
- **Anti-camping**: Maximum 1 hour per zone, 30-minute cooldown

### 4. Auto-Scaling
- **Dynamic instance creation**: Based on load thresholds
- **Resource reclamation**: Inactive instances cleaned up after 5 minutes
- **Category-based scaling**: Different rules for different instance types

## ðŸ”’ Security and Consistency

### 1. Distributed Locking (Redlock)
- **Critical operations protected**:
  - Bazaar trading: `lock:bazaar_item:DIAMOND`
  - Auction house: `lock:auction:auction123`
  - Player operations: `lock:player:uuid`
  - Guild operations: `lock:guild:guild456`

### 2. Transaction Safety
- **Atomic operations** with MongoDB
- **Distributed locks** prevent race conditions
- **Rollback mechanisms** for failed operations

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **1000 requests per minute** per player
- **Burst limit** of 100 requests
- **Distributed rate limiting** across Redis cluster

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Metrics

## ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion

The distributed microservice architecture has been successfully implemented according to all specified requirements. The system now provides:

- **Multi-threaded performance** with Minestom
- **Distributed consistency** with Redlock algorithm
- **Scalable instance management** with auto-scaling
- **Intelligent player routing** based on progression
- **High-performance caching** with Redis cluster
- **Persistent data storage** with optimized MongoDB schema

This architecture eliminates the fundamental limitations of monolithic Bukkit/Spigot systems and provides a solid foundation for a high-performance Hypixel Skyblock recreation that can scale to thousands of concurrent players while maintaining low latency and high availability.
